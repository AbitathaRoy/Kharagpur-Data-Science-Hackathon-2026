    "verdict": "consistent",
    "reason": "The user's claim does not explicitly contradict any of the established facts. The scenario described (uninvited lecture attendance, shouting about a geographical coordinate) is not addressed in the provided facts, which focus on different character traits and events."

    "verdict": "consistent",
    "reason": "The claim aligns with established facts about Valentine\u2019s evolving expertise in interpreting Noirtier\u2019s communication. The facts confirm her method improved over six years and involved eye fixation on a dictionary. The claim\u2019s mention of a blink-code as an evolved method post-paralysis is not explicitly contradicted, as the facts do not specify the exact mechanics of her communication system beyond eye movement and dictionary use."

    "verdict": "consistent",
    "reason": "The user's claim involves actions (caching weapons, torching a trader, raising a stone marker) and a reawakened conscience, none of which directly contradict the established facts. The facts mention conscience providing excuses after exertion, which aligns with the claim's focus on repentance. No explicit factual violations are present."

    "verdict": "contradict",
    "reason": "The claim introduces a 'half-brother' and a 'French stepfather,' but established facts state Robert is a full brother (wife died at his birth) and no stepfather is mentioned. The claim also fabricates details not present in the source material."
